This mod will allow you to have anything that grows or is harvested on humus to be planted anywhere. All of the wild items are untouched and will only appear in those areas however all seeds can be placed anywhere you like. This is mostely useful with the Mud Block mod for aesthetic reasons.

This mod has been tested to work on v14b. It should work on all versions down to v9.

I have released this mod as part of the GPLv3 which means that you may use this mod and distribute it freely but you must include this file with it. If you modify the files and pass it on then please give credit where due.
