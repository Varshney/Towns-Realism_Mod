This mod will allow you to create Mud Blocks that will fill in terrain holes. Unfortunately no matter how many workarounds I've attempted there is no other way to use these mud blocks like a Dirt Terrain tile so please treat it like a wall. The way this Mud Block works is as follows:

-	To access the Mud Block it's in the right menu at the bottom with a Dirt Terrain tile
-	You must have at least 1 mud material to create the block
-	It can block all fluids
x	It cannot be used like dirt
x	You can not build it like wall pieces (e.g. gluing together to make a bridge)
x	You cannot till for plantation

This mod has been tested to work on v14b. It should work on all versions down to v9.

I have released this mod as part of the GPL which means that you may use this mod and distribute it freely but you must include this file with it. If you modify the files and pass it on then please give credit where due.
